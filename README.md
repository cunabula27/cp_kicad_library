# cp_kicad_library

Library of symbols and footprints I've created for KiCad projects.

Probably not the best source if you're looking for stuff to use, a lot of them are just customisations of already existing components in the main KiCad libraries, just with all the elements moved so that the centre of the button or pot shaft is the centre of the footprint. Easier for me to make well designed front panels that way.

That sort of thing.

Subject to a lot of changes as I'm learning as I go.
